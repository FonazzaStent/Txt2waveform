# Txt2waveform
Convert words to waveforms you can load into a synthesizer oscillator to create a synth instrument sound
The program will convert a short text (max 35 characters) to a waveform and save it into a sound file in WAV format (11025Hz, 8bit). The waveform can be loaded into a synthesizer oscillator inside a DAW, such as the 3xOsc bundled with all versions of FL Studio from Image Line. Envelopes, Filters and other effects can be applied to create a playable instrument. You can turn your name, your city name, your pet's name or your favorite team's name into a synthesizer sound.
The Python script requires Python installed on your system to work. Download the latest version at www.python.org. If you don't want to install Python, you can just run the executable file included in the package. Once you start the program, it will prompt you for a word. You can input, for instance, your name. The program only understands lowercase and capital letters, spaces and all other punctuation signs will be ignored, numbers and all non-letter characters will be ignored. The word or sentence can be up to 35 characters long. Longer words or sentences will be chopped after 35 characters. After you input your word and press Enter, the program will save the waveform to a file called wave.wav and close itself. You can now open your synth and import the file as a waveform into the oscillator.
The package contains a file with the waveform corresponding the the word "Hello".
