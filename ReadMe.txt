Text to Waveform 1.1.0

The program will convert text to a waveform and save it to a sound file in WAV format (11025Hz, 8 bit).
Paste or write text into the text window, click on the Convert command in the File menu, choose a filename and a folder to save the resulting waveform. Click on the Clear command in the File menu to Clear the text Window.
If you use a single word or a very short text, the waveform can be loaded into a synthesizer oscillator, such as the 3xOsc bundled with all versions of FL Studio from Image Line. Envelopes, Filters and other effects can be applied to create a playable instrument. You can turn your name, your city name, your pet's name or your favorite team's name into a synthesizer sound. Longer texts will result in a longer soundfile resembling digital white noise.
The executable file runs under Windows from any folder needing no additional software installed.
The Python script contained in the source code requires Python installed on your system to work. Download the latest version at www.python.org
The program only understands lowercase and capital letters. Spaces and all other punctuation signs, numbers and all non-letter characters will be ignored.
